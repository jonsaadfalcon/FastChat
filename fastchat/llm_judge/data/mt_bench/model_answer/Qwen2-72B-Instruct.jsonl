Here are some key business etiquette norms to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Punctuality**: Being on time is crucial in Japanese business culture. Arriving late is considered disrespectful and can negatively impact your professional image.\n\n2. **Business Cards (Meishi)**: The exchange of business cards is a formal ritual. Present your card with both hands, facing the recipient, and receive theirs in the same manner. Take a moment to read the card respectfully before putting it away.\n\n3. **Hierarchy and Titles**: Respect for hierarchy is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture. Always address people by their title and last name, and be mindful of the seniority of those in the room.\n\n4. **Formality and Politeness**: Use formal language and maintain a polite demeanor. Avoid being overly direct or confrontational, as this can be seen as rude.\n\n5. **Bowing**: Bowing is a common greeting in Japan. The depth and duration of the bow should match the formality of the situation and the status of the person you are greeting.\n\n6. **Dress Code**: Dress conservatively and professionally. Men typically wear dark suits, and women should wear modest, professional attire.\n\n7. **Meetings**: Meetings are often used to exchange information rather than to make decisions. Be prepared to listen more than you speak, and avoid interrupting others.\n\n8. **Decision Making**: Decisions are often made by consensus and can take time. Patience is key, and pushing for quick decisions can be counterproductive.\n\n9. **Gift Giving**: Gift giving is a common practice in Japanese business culture, especially when visiting a company or attending a meeting. Gifts should be modest and wrapped nicely.\n\n10. **Dining Etiquette**: If you are invited to a business meal, be aware of proper dining etiquette.
